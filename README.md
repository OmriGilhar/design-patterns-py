# Design Patterns  

----------
***What are design patterns?***  
Design patterns are typical solutions to commonly occurring problems in 
software design. They are like pre-made blueprints that you can customize 
to solve a recurring design problem in your code.

In this repository I will occasionally add basic implementation of a design 
pattern, also, a README.md file to explain about the design pattern.

**Note:** All my implementation will be code in Python 3.x.
